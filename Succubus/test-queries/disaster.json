The weather system brought unusually heavy rainfall to Central America. El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras have been particularly impacted, with Guatemala experiencing the highest amount of rainfall since 1949, with precipitation ranging from 8 to 14 inches between May 25 and 28. More than 150,000 people have already been evacuated from their homes in the region. The situation is still developing as rain continues to fall, leading to more flooding and landslide risk. </span></span>",

As well as causing a substantial humanitarian impact, the floods have rendered some villages inaccesible, due to damaged bridges or blocked roads, and submerged public facilities including health centres and schools. Based on preliminary information, some 14,400 families (around 55,900 people) have been affected across 5 provinces. ",

Currently 1.3 million people in eastern Syria are affected, and an estimated 800,000 have lost most of their income and are facing extreme hardship. These conditions have triggered a substantial increase in the rate of migration from villages in the affected areas to urban centers during the past year.  Urgent humanitarian action is needed to enable residents of eastern Syria to remain in their homes and avoid further migration to Damascus and other cities.  </span></span>",

Over half a million people had been displaced and lost almost everything. More than five years since the end of the conflict in 2009, a majority of the people displaced have returned to their home areas. The government and partners have committed significant resources to help former IDPs to resettle and reconstruct houses. There are no ‘new IDPs’ living in camps in the country. ",

    "Summary__c": "As of June 2014, levels of accumulated rainfall in affected areas in Honduras and other Central American regions have been 50 to 75 per cent below the average. The water shortage has caused crop losses as well as a decrease in the purchasing power of families living in the affected areas. Losses during the first harvest are estimated to be between 17 and 44 per cent, while losses to subsistence farmers in the most affected areas are expected to exceed 70 per cent. Extremely poor households in Honduras will experience a rapid deterioration in food security due to the poor harvest forecast for 2014 and the faster than normal rise in the prices of basic goods.",
