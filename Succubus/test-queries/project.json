    "Summary__c": "<p><font size=\"3\">&quot;Empowering Young Women to Lead Transformative Change&quot; aims to address social taboos, educate, and strengthen the capacities of vulnerable young women 18 to 25 years old. The beneficiaries will stem from poor economic backgrounds, with limited social and political power, low self-esteem, and little career opportunities. During its 12 month duration, the project will take place at the YWCA Haiti Center, located at #52 Rue Goulard, Petion-Ville, Haiti. A total of 240 young women will benefit directly from weekly Leadership Academy trainings and an additional 15 will receive training from the Institut de Développement Personnel et Organisationnel S.A.(IDEO), an implementing partner. IDEO is contracted to instruct mentor trainers using the material that has recently been developed by YWCA Haiti, HAGN and other partners; and to help monitor, along with a contracted M&amp;E specialist, trained young women’s performance. By the end of the program, these young women will have the capacity to continue training the current mentors of the 16 organizations belonging to the Haiti Adolescent Girls Network delivering the Espas Pa Mwen program in the West and Southeast Department. This will enable the YWCA Haiti to continue it’s Leadership Academy program as well as strengthen the capacities and sustainable aspect of the HAGN mentors. The current staff of the YWCA Haiti and the Haiti Adolescent Girls Network will be in charge of implementing the project. </font></p>",

    "Summary__c": "Canaan is a rapidly emerging city north of Port-au-Prince in the West Department, now estimated to be between 100,000 and 150,000 residents. Canaan developed after the 2010 earthquake in response to the establishment and operation of a relocation settlement as well as a Haitian government declaration of eminent domain of the surrounding area. The city has received little external assistance from Haitian authorities or the international community. However, Canaan continues to grow with grassroots investments by local households; these investments were estimated at US$100 million as of July 2013.<br><br>The lack of government oversight has caused Canaan to grow similarly to informal settlements of Port-au- Prince, with poor access to basic services, construction and urbanization in areas at high exposure to natural hazard, and inadequate waste management systems. Furthermore, social cohesion in Canaan is only in nascent stages, given that most of the residents have been there for approximately two years or less.<br><br>This program represents the first significant investment in the zone in social engagement, coming at a critical time before United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in partnership with American Red Cross (ARC) and Unité de Construction de Logements et de Bâtiments Publics (UCLBP) begins implementation of the $12 million, livelihoods and infrastructure work in early 2015 as part of the Canaan Urban Development Program. This program proposes to build community cohesion by establishing fair community representation structures and engaging the community in common concerns surrounding Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and the environment. This work will provide a foundation for future implementing actors in the city to begin work. The program therefore proposes to start in December 2014 and continue for 18 months until May 2016. As this program is one of the first interventions in Canaan, it aims to target the entire population, an estimated 100,000 to 150,000 people. In particular, marginalized groups (including women and youth) will receive greater emphasis to ensure they are fairly represented in community structures.<br><br>The overall program goal is to mobilize and organize the communities within Canaan to improve their resilience. This will be accomplished through three programmatic axes: (1) social engagement; (2) disaster risk reduction; (3) environmental engagement. <br><br>These three axes correspond to three program objectives: \n<ol><li>Increase community cohesion, representation and capacity to engage national and local government, as well as international organizations; </li><li>Communities are better prepared against natural disasters with increased understanding of natural hazards and risks;</li><li>Increase community understanding of local environmental concerns and engagement for improving the environmental status.</li></ol>\nThese objectives will be accomplished by coordinating with the Haitian government and other implementing actors to define a common social engagement approach and to establish community platforms that are representative of the communities. These platforms will engage Haitian authorities and support community assessments in DRR and environmental concerns, as well as the establishment of long-term entities responsible for follow up activities (e.g. establishing Community Intervention Teams with Department of Civil Protection).<br><br>The program will be directly implemented by ARC in close coordination with the Haitian Red Cross (HRC). Consultants will be engaged on a punctual basis for surge capacity or technical expertise. The HRC will play a vital role in mobilizing their volunteer network in Canaan to build community cohesion and buy in as well as conduct household level messaging on key messages related to DRR and the environment.",

It will also allow for the continued delivery of medical care to the general public through the Hospital’s walk-in Triage Department that is currently open 24 hours, seven days per week. HUEH is the largest medical center in Haiti and the sole public national referral hospital for specialty care. The national public health system in Haiti relies on HUEH for care that is otherwise unavailable anywhere else within the country. The PIH/ZL program to provide staff salary for Haitian HUEH staff for nine months will provide the immediate support required for the hospital to adequately and sustainably care for the patients in its wards and at its doors. </p>",

    "Summary__c": "<p>Canaan, a suburb of Croix-des-Bouquets, located North of the Greater Port-au-Prince Metropolitan area, has been settled by surviviors of the 2010 earthquake in a rapidly growing urbanization process.  As of 2013, the growing population was estimated between 100,000 and 150,000 inhabitants. The agglomaration lacks the basic social services, including functional public medical or health services. The state health referral center located nearby is not functional due to the unavailability of medical staff and other critical resources.</p>\n\n<p>The GoH, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and their partners have made a considerable investment of roughly $18M through the construction of a the Sport for Hope Center, the largest sports facility of its kind in Haiti.  The sports complex aims at supporting social development through sports funded by the IOC and the United Nations.  It offers, among other services, a First Aid and Emergency Health Point (FAEHP) operated by the Haitian Red Cross.</p>\n\n<p>The FAEHP provides key services to the sports complex in the area of injury management as it represents the only functional medical facility in the area. As such, it provides services not only to the sports center but also to the surrounding communities of Canaan.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of this project is to increase resilience of the Sport for Hope Center&#39;s users and Canaan community members through improved access to first aid and emergency health services.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<p> </p>",

The governance at regional and sub-regional levels is of paramount importance in providing appropriate guidance and direction. The main problem at these levels arises when the governance is not active or provides ineffective leadership. Key reasons which account for this situation include limited understanding of the Red Cross structure and fundamental principles, as well as the systems and roles of the governance in supporting the national society to achieve its mission. </span>The 2012 elections brought in a number of new faces to the governance leadership. Over 80% of those who were elected at regional level are their first term in governance leadership. This means that the majority of the newly elected governance members have limited understanding of the Red Cross movement, its fundamental principles and statutes; a situation which contributes to their inefficiency in providing guidance and decision making in the day to day Red Cross endeavors. The national society has inducted RMC members from only ten out of twenty regions with regional governance structure; it has failed to induct governance members from the remaining regions due to financial limitations.<br> <br>The proposed project will therefore enable the national society to organize for induction seminars in early January 2015 for RMCs from the remaining ten regions of Dar es Salaam, Dodoma, Morogoro, Mtwara, Pwani, Kaskazini Pemba, Kusini Pemba, Kusini Unguja, Kaskazini Unguja and Mjini Magharibi. Through this project, the governance members will be imparted with relevant knowledge, empowering them to effectively play their roles as envisaged. The implementation of this project will also complete the induction process of governance members from all TRCS regions currently within the regional governance structure.",

Camp committees and private initiatives are investing in provision of basic services such as community schools, free clinics and shops as most of the camps are socially organized as communities. The process of camp transformation into neighborhood is ongoing without proper planning guidelines and provision of adequate infrastructure. The main risk is the expansion of existing informal and underserviced areas with poor quality and unsafe constructions, in the absence of development controls. </p>\n\t<p class=\"p1\">\n\t\tRental subsidies for camp closure are currently the main governmental intervention addressing camp issues while the Housing Policy, developed by the Unité de Construction de Logements et de Bâtiments Publics (UCLBP) with support of UN-Habitat, identifies other options like camp formalization, retrofitting rental units, sites and services. Even though a high proportion of the rental subsidy funds are used by landlords to upgrade their buildings, external evaluation on rental allocations show that after one year 75% of the returning families do not remain in the rental accommodation identified and approved under the subsidy scheme. The Camp Coordination and Camp Management cluster (CCCM) is doing an evaluation of rental subsidies impacts, and exploring other options and alternatives such as camp formalization. </p>\n\t<p class=\"p1\">\n\t\tThe project aims to assist the government bodies (UCLBP, relevant ministries) and municipal authorities in the building of consensus regarding all camp exit strategies including the less developed alternative of in situ camps upgrading and urban integration. The objective is to strengthen analysis and decision making with a view to ending displacement based on case-by-case survey of specific camps in consultation with the CCCM Cluster.</p>\n\t<p class=\"p1\">\n\t\tThe project proposes to formalize 2 or 3 selected camps through urban integration with the surrounding neighborhood and through provision of support which could include housing support, rental subsidies, access to basic services such as road, water and sanitation networks, or a combination of these options. The project evaluation, which will be based on lessons learned from the implementation and processes applied, will contribute to systematize the full approach in order to replicate the process. In this vein, the project will provide a platform of methodological support and improved tools to “end displacement”, focusing on “camp formalization”.</p>\n\t<p class=\"p1\">\n\t\tGiven the Nations’ commitment to use the recovery phase to bridge and support the development of Haiti, this opportunity of guiding the process for camp formalization could pave the way for urban revitalization by looking at a multitude of cross-sectoral issues related to urban development such as local governance, community empowerment, training and capacity building, land issues, housing, in addition to access to basic services, water and sanitation.</p>\n</div>\n<br>",

    "Summary__c": "The purpose of this project is to identify the causes of injuries and deaths in the April 25 earthquake, which will then provide a basis for education and training of the Nepali public in basic disaster preparedness. Through this study, the implementing agency will seek to answer research questions related to: risk factors associated with injuries; environmental hazards; risk mitigation efforts; disaster response behavior of the public; importance of rapid search and rescue and medical treatment to specific injury outcomes; public perception of effective and feasible ways of disaster preparedness.<br><br>1. Design and finalize interviewer-friendly and coding-ready survey form in both English and Nepali<br>2. Develop scientific random sampling methodology<br>3. Conduct field data collection of 500 households residing in regular households and IDP camps using mobile survey application on mobile devices<br>4. Manage survey data uploaded in central server under supervision of dedicated IT and data management personnel<br>5. Conduct data analysis of the data collected from epidemiological survey; health facility records; perception of health workers and service seekers<br>6. Prepare a research report up to 5000 words with a focus on instructive summary statistics and implications for disaster preparedness<br>7. Translate the research report into Nepali<br>8. Develop a 4-page public education summary of findings in English and Nepali<br><br>The contract for the full research assignment will be held between Save the Children and HERD. The contract will be shared with the American Red Cross. Save the Children and the American Red Cross commit to working together to use the findings of the research throughout 2016.

    "Summary__c": "On January 12, 2010, Haiti was hit by a devastating earthquake. The Saint-Louis de Gonzague school, one of the most respected academic-based schools in Haiti, suffered severe damage, particularly the school premises in the city center of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-au-Prince\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Port-au-Prince\">Port-au-Prince</a>, which were completely destroyed. Historically the school grounds served the community; as a space for youth to exercise and for community groups to host activities aimed at children. To restore this valuable community space, Global Communities will restore and constuct a six-lane certified running track that will serve 1,400 students from the St Louis de Gonzague school and approximately 12,000 students from eight schools in the neighboring Delmas area, as well as athelets that train or compete for the Haiti Field and Track Association. The budget for the track is $150,000. Global Communities will use eight weeks of build time, late April to late June, to complete the project.",

In FY17, OD support will focus on continuing to leverage impact and sustainability by building on some of the existing OD partnerships that may include national societies in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Such strategic initiatives, including strengthening youth and volunteer engagement, branch capacity, leadership, and governance, will remain a priority. Support will be leveraged to ensure national society partner’s priorities are met to build effective systems and strengthen leadership capacity in order to implement sustainable programs for effective service delivery.  ",

But it can be easily prevented through vaccination. Clinically, almost similar to measles, rubella infection causes milder disease than measles. In pregnant women, the virus infects the placenta and developing fetus, rubella causes variety if physical defects, collectively known as Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS). </span></span><br><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Coordinated efforts under National Health Policy contribute towards improving health status and achieving the MDGs. Increase in availability of health facilities and mobilization of health volunteers at grass root levels and promotion of public, private partnerships often contribute to addressing health issues at community level. Alongside this, humanitarian and development partners are also often pivotal in playing a key role in augmenting the Government of Nepal capacity to reduce the burden of measles and rubella. </span></span><br><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">On April 25th, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck 48 miles northwest of Kathmandu, Nepal, affecting an estimated 8 million people across 41 districts in Nepal’s West and Central Regions. Of these 41 districts, 14 have been identified as highly affected. </span></span><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Apart from attending to the immediate needs for the medical care, food, shelter, access of water and sanitation for these districts, preventive public health interventions are also equally critical for considerations as humanitarian emergency. </span></span><br><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">One of the measures currently being organized by Ministry of Health and their partners, including Nepal Red Cross in response to the earthquake is will be to carry out a mass immunization campaign. As a key partner to the MOPH, the Nepal Red Cross will support the MOHP in carrying out the mass vaccination campaign through the implementation of social mobilization activities.</span></span><br> <br><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Such efforts will be invaluable in contributing towards preventable diseases but also in working towards achievements of the millennium development goals (MDGs) through improvements in maternal and child health. </span></span><br> <br><b><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Proposed activities for NRCS Campaign Coverage</span></span></b><br><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">NRCS has been involved in previous immunization campaigns in three key areas, which have included: firstly, NRCS local chapters mobilizing its volunteers at vaccination booths, secondly NRCS have carried out social mobilization activities in focused in geographical areas and thirdly NRCS have integrated immunization dissemination and motivation messages for routine vaccination in relevant health projects. Therefore, similar activities will be carried out in the upcoming mass vaccination campaign.</span></span><br> <br><b><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Overall Campaign Goal: </span></span></b><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">To immunize children between 6 months to 5 years to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with measles and rubella.</span></span><br> <br><b><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Overall Campaign Objective</span></span></b>:\n<ul><li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">To immunize all children between 6 months to 5 years of the 14 most earthquake affected districts of Nepal</span></span></li><li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Increase awareness among people about the immunization campaign to ensure their participation</span></span></li></ul>\n <br><b><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Nepal Red Cross Society Goal</span></span></b><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">: To contribute to the Ministry of Health and Population Measles and Rubella campaign in the 14 most earthquake affected districts (Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Kavre, Sindhupalchok, Dolakha, Ramechhap, Okhaldhunga, Sindhuli, Nuwakot, Rasuwa, Dhading, Gorkha, Makwanpur) through key social mobilization activities.</span></span><br> <br> <br><b><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Outcome</span></span></b>\n\n<ol><li><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Reach target population with messages through mobilization of volunteers and school students</span></span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Increased coordination among stakeholders at central and district level</span></span></li></ol>",

The lack of local skilled labor, effective management, educated leadership, and institutional capacity are recognized as significant impediments to progress at all levels.  By supporting professional training and internships, as well as leadership development and community service experience to students in HELP’s comprehensive univeristy scholarship program, this project contributes to increasing economic opportunities for young Haitians while also building technical capacity in country. The goal of this project is for HELP’s student body of 150 academically talented, socioeconomically disadvantaged young men and women to make progress towards gaining leadership and employment skills that will enable them to access economic opportunities and to contribute to positive change in Haiti. </p>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">The project has two interconnected objectives:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Internships &amp; Career Services: To plan and implement an internship program enabling HELP students to contribute to capacity building for, and access potential employment opportunities at, local development organizations, including ARC and its international affiliates and partners; </li><li>Leadership Program: To build the capacity of HELP’s four-year leadership curriculum providing access to training in leadership, civics, citizenship, and community service to a student body of 150, including the expansion of HELP’s nationwide outreach activities that provide secondary school students across the country with knowledge of educational opportunities available at HELP, with a particular focus on connecting HELP students with ARC-affiliated youth group members in the Carrefour Feuilles neighborhood through community engagement activities.</li></ol>",

    "Summary__c": "The Pillowcase Project has been successfully introduced in schools in several cities in the United States to effectively teach preparedness concepts to elementary school students.  As part of the program’s curriculum, Red Cross staff and volunteers teach a 60 minute disaster preparedness lesson in a classroom setting using a pillowcase that can be filled with items to help prepare youth for a disaster.  Items can include extra clothing and shoes, flashlight, water, comfort items, toothbrush, and other items a child may need if they have to leave their home following a disaster.  Some of the hallmarks of success, including the short time period and the fun aspect and the practical application, indicate a natural opportunity for translation to other languages and contexts. The American Red Cross and the Global Disaster Preparedness Center have received a grant from the Disney to support the expansion of the program in six countries as a pilot and proof of concept starting in August 2013 and completed by December 31, 2015.<br>With its school based disaster risk reduction programming, the Red Cross network is able to provide school-age children with critical disaster management skills that enable them to be more resilient to absorbing the shocks and stresses of disasters. Students will also be better prepared to manage and cope with the harmful negative effects of disasters, thus, ensuring the safety of their student populations.<br>The intended outcome of the pilot is to determine the method of implementation of the Pillowcase Program in countries outside of the United States. There are three key outputs:<br>1.Create a framework for national societies to participate in Pillow Case Project\n<ul><li>Collaborate with Disney and International Services Response and Programs unit to identify three pilot national societies</li><li>Procure pillow cases</li><li>Create a ordering system for pillow cases that is easy for the national society to use (and efficient)</li></ul>\n2.Design a scalable version of the Pillowcase Project that is easy to adapt and localize for different countries.\n\n<ul><li>Build on the work done domestically by the American Red Cross to create a model lesson plan and other tools for adaptation by the national society</li></ul>\n3.Conduct learning, evaluations and address lessons learned\n\n<ul><li>Conduct classroom learning in 10-15 schools in each of the pilot countries</li><li>Conduct evaluation on the efficacy of the classroom learning</li></ul>",

Beyond the use of such technologies in response to a disaster, it is of interest to better understand how social media could be used to inform vulnerable populations before a disaster strikes and enhance their disaster preparedness. This information will allow the Red Cross to better adapt their own programming and communication strategies to enable vulnerable communities to better prepare for and cope with disasters.\n<div> </div>",

In areas formerly under separatist control, now re-taken by the Government, divisions have emerged between returnees and those who remained during the period of separatist control. As the current conflict winds down, repairing and bridging the social cleavages that have emerged or have been exacerbated by the crisis will be a key element of community resilience.<br><br>American Red Cross will submit a proposal on behalf of a consortium consisting of ARC, Ukrainian Red Cross, and Danish Red Cross.  While the detailed needs assessment and program design will begin the week of March 23, preliminary discussions have defined an arrangement where Ukrainian RC serve as the primary implementers of a P2P approach focused on the relations between IDPs and host communities.  Activities are expected to draw on the strong volunteer base of the national society and strong work with youth.  Danish RC is being engaged as a key technical partner, delivering technical assistance related to community-based psychosocial services and youth resilience programming, as well as on approaches to building social cohesion.  American Red Cross is taking the lead role in coordination and management, delivering technical assistance on monitoring and evaluation, project management and compliance, and managing donor reporting for the consortium. ",

The daily violence in the neighborhood and the weak involvement of the state has important effects on the absence of security and well-being of the community, struck by unemployment, poverty and crime. In this context, the youth is offered little opportunity to engage in public debate and civic integration. Within the framework of this project, FOKAL wants to address the question of civic education, in order to convey a better knowledge and understanding of civic, health and educational issues. FOKAL also wants to give the youth the tools they need to build their own conscious, organic and reflective vision of the obstacles they face. FOKAL’s project is focused on an area of Martissant, where it has led integrated grassroots projects since 2007. The project responds to the first and second objectives of the ARC Youth Engagement Program.<br>The overall <b>GOAL</b> is to contribute to the emergence of a feeling of civic engagement among the youth of Martissant.<br><br><b><u>The specific Objectives</u></b> of the project are:\n<ul><li style=\"text-align: justify;\">To train young people of Martissant on human rights and civics;</li><li style=\"text-align: justify;\">To empower young people of Martissant with professional tools,</li><li style=\"text-align: justify;\">To empower local NGO’s to enhance life skills for better psychological and physical health. </li></ul>",

This powerful earthquake was followed by another major earthquake of magnitude 7.3 on May 12 and thousands of aftershocks including more than 380 of magnitude 4.0 or greater. The earthquakes and subsequent aftershocks caused widespread destruction and loss of life. More than 8,800 people died, and another 100,000 were injured. </span><span style=\"color: black;\">N</span><span style=\"color: black;\">early 600,000 houses were destroyed and 280,000 damaged by the quakes, forcing nearly 3 million people out of their homes and into makeshift shelters. More than 5,000 schools and 1,200 health facilities <span>were heavily damaged or destroyed, hindering provision of education services to more than a million children and primary health care services to whole communities in earthquake-affected areas. </span></span><span style=\"color: black;\">The Government of Nepal (GoN) Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA), undertaken in May 2015, estimated that the earthquake caused NPR 706 billion (the equivalent of $7 billion) in damages overall, including homes, government buildings, heritage sites, schools and health posts, rural roads, bridges, water supply systems, agricultural land, trekking routes, and hydropower plants.</span><span><span style=\"color: black;\"> In the 14 most-affected districts, </span></span><span style=\"color: black;\">46% of water supply systems were damaged and approximately 220,000 toilets partially or totally destroyed. D<span>isruptions to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) systems create increased risk of communicable diseases such as diarrhoea, respiratory infections, and mosquito-borne illnesses.</span></span><br> <br><span style=\"color: black;\">Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS), in partnership with American Red Cross (ARC), Spanish Red Cross (SpRC) and Canadian Red Cross (CRC), propose to undertake a three year post-earthquake integrated recovery program in 19 Village Development Committees (VDCs) and one municipality of three of the 14 most affected districts of Nepal: Nuwakot, Rasuwa and Makwanpur. The Utthan program will focus on long-term recovery and community resilience building.</span><br> <br><i><span style=\"color: black;\">The overall goal of the program is to<b> contribute to the sustainable recovery of vulnerable earthquake-affected households and develop safer, more resilient communities</b></span></i><span style=\"color: black;\">. Program objectives are:</span><br> <br><b>Objective 1</b>: Vulnerable earthquake-affected households and communities increase the ability to self-organize and take actions to recover quicker and build back safer by adopting improved resilience practices to disasters<br> <br><b>Objective 2</b>: Vulnerable earthquake-affected households and communities increase access to safe and sustainable infrastructure and basic services to better meet household needs.<br> <br><b>Objective 3</b>: NRCS increases organizational and technical capacity to manage and implement community-based recovery, resilience and readiness to respond programming.<br> <br><span style=\"color: black;\">Building on the principles and strategies laid out in the NRCS draft recovery framework, The Utthan program will adopt a community-driven integrated approach to self-recovery and resilience building. </span>An integrated program approach recognizes that single sector interventions cannot be done in isolation from other interventions and that there is a strong need for a holistic approach. Appropriate and sustainable shelter solutions are more than four walls and a roof: it’s about increasing access to water and sanitation, adopting healthy behaviours and improving employment or livelihood opportunities. The Red Cross will focus on an integrated approach which looks at the main services needed for a community to thrive and which involves working side by side with local residents, engaging them as active participants and decision makers in their recovery process. Interventions must not only be comprehensive and managed in a holistic manner; they must be based on the expressed desires, wishes and active participation of the affected population. The Red Cross role will be to facilitate the process whereby implementation is carried out by those affected and not on behalf of those affected. Community members must have the necessary knowledge, skills and motivation to self-organize, identify risk, establish priorities to take individual and collective actions, and advocate for their needs. <span style=\"color: black;\">In addition to capacity building, the program will also provide essential financial or in-kind materials support to vulnerable earthquake-affected households and communities to recover quicker and to better meet immediate household needs. The program will take a holistic comprehensive approach and where appropriate will integrate and mainstream cross-cutting themes, including: gender and diversity, to ensure inclusion of the most vulnerable groups (such as female and child headed households, persons with disabilities, Dalit and other marginalized caste/ethnic groups); environmental sustainability; and disaster risk reduction (DRR). </span><br> <br><span style=\"color: black;\">Resources will be allocated to further enhance and build the organizational and technical capacity of the NRCS at both the national headquarters and the district chapter level. NRCS district chapter capacity building will be based on detailed district chapter capacity assessments undertaken at the start of the program. Human resource development will include: ensuring that chapters have sufficient and appropriate trained and skilled staff; targeted trainings for NRCS staff and volunteers to develop essential skills for facilitating community-based recovery, resilience and readiness to respond </span><span style=\"color: black;\">(such as post-disaster rapid and detailed assessments, participatory planning, community mobilization, Behaviour Change Communication (BCC), technical trainings, first aid, etc.); and recruiting and training volunteer district disaster response teams. Organizational systems strengthening will include contributing to the development/refinement of NRCS MIS systems at both headquarter and district chapter levels; building district operational capacity in areas such as warehouse management and early warning systems. Hardware support will include supporting district chapters to rehabilitate/construct safe, sustainable and appropriate buildings, including warehouses, and provision of other necessary assets, including fleet, IT and communications support. NRCS headquarters capacity building will focus on strengthening the ERO and relevant NRCS technical departments.</span><br> <br><span style=\"color: black;\">The recovery program timeline will begin from October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2018. The first 90 days will focus on start-up operations and project inception, including: hiring and training of staff, conducting rapid participatory integrated assessments with the development of community action plans, building community trust and cohesion through social mobilization. Community mobilization and the development of community specific actions plans at the onset will ensure designed interventions are community-driven and provide an integrated package of services that meet the unique needs and cultural aspects in each respective community. Based on the results of the integrated assessments and community action plan the program will develop a detailed implementation plan focused on the sectoral activities and interventions the Red Cross will deliver. While initial project design is an iterative process through the inception phase, initial program plans intend to target 3,000 vulnerable earthquake-affected households with an integrated package of services and support with the Red Cross primarily focused on providing sectoral support in the areas of shelter, WASH and livelihoods and working with a wider set of partners to ensure other prioritized areas and needs a fully met. Additionally, the program will provide support at the wider community level in 19 VDCs providing coverage to an estimated 20,636 households through interventions that include improving community water schemes, providing WASH services in selected schools and health posts in each VDC, community health promotion and selected community-level livelihoods activities. The total proposed program budget is $17.6</span> <span style=\"color: black;\">million implemented over a three year period. </span></h1>",

    "Summary__c": "<span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">Dar Es Salaam, in eastern Tanzania, is a bustling urban center home to approximately 4.4 million residents, and is the economic center of Tanzania.<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">[1]</span></span></span></span></a></span></span> Dar es Salaam is also a city prone to regular flooding and has experienced four major floods in the past ten years. The main causes of flooding in Dar es Salaam are inadequate and blocked drainage systems. Flood effects are then amplified by unplanned and crowded settlements, weak municipal capacity to issue flood warnings and evacuate communities in high-risk areas, and poor sanitation infrastructure. Most recently, in April 2014 three days of heavy rain led to extensive flooding throughout the city, leaving 19 people dead, and 20,000 people displaced from their homes. Major service delivery systems such as roads, water and sewage systems were also impacted.<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\"><span><span style=\"color: black;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">[2]</span></span></span></span></a><br> <br><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">In protracted debates over the best strategy for government agencies and the Red Cross to intervene based on a forecast, a lack of funding to carry out significant early action measures and a lack of standardized operating procedures, identifying the most appropriate actions to take, are often cited as clear and insurmountable challenges. This contributes to a decreased sense of responsibility and accountability to act. This project aims to contribute to progress toward overcoming these challenges by focusing on the most flood prone areas of Dar es Salaam. A consortium of institutions comprised of the World Bank, Ardhi Univeristy, the Tanzania Red Cross Society, the American Red Cross, the Danish Red Cross and the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre will implement this project in coordination with local authorities.</span></span>\n<div> \n<hr></hr>\n<div><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\"><span><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">[1]</span></span></span></a> National Bereau of Statistics (2013) <i>Tanzania in Figures 2012</i> Dar es Salaam, Tanzania</div>\n\n<div><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\"><span><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">[2]</span></span></span></a> Reliefweb (2014 May 27) Retreived 15 August 2014 from http://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-2014-000053-tza</div>\n</div>",

    "Summary__c": "<span style=\"font-family: calibri,sans-serif;\">The purpose of this project is to support the Restoring Family Links (RFL) program in serving more clients and providing more consistent and effective services through the establishment of a centralized call center. Existing American Red Cross call center technology will be leveraged to address the need for a sustained investment in technology, management, volunteer engagement and training as well as sustaining elements of the current RFL core functions for Movement coordination and partnerships. It is anticipated that establishment of an RFL call center will further the organization’s goals of  reducing costs, improving quality, and increasing efficiency of RFL services. Call agents from the Red Cross volunteer workforce will be cross-trained and cross-utilized to serve RFL and other clients at the Red Cross. Through this project the American Red Cross will have piloted and tested a call center model and be able to transition from a decentralized to a more central casework system for RFL that will have a lasting impact on improved quality for RFL clients and benefit the organization’s call center infrastructure through training a larger and more diverse pool of volunteers.</span><br> ",

Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, fell under the control of ISIS on June 10, followed by most of the surrounding Ninewah province. Security conditions have also worsened in Salah al-Din and Diyala provinces. </span></span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><font face=\"symbol\">T</font><font face=\"arial, sans-serif\">he recent violence has displaced more than 650,000 people to the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. If the situation continues to deteriorate, humanitarian organizations expect significant additional displacements. </font></span><span style=\"font-family: arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">This rapid population movement adds to the approximate 550,000 people displaced since January by a surge of violence in central and northern Iraq, and the more than 200,000 refugees from the Syria crisis currently residing in Iraq. Overall, an estimated 1.5 million people, including displaced persons, host communities and communities under siege are in need of humanitarian assistance in Iraq, a 300 percent increase from February. </span></span><span style=\"font-family: arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Humanitarian actors are mobilizing all resources available to scale up emergency operations across Iraq. Priority humanitarian needs are food, water and fuel. Protection and the risk of disease outbreak are also concerns, primarily for the hundreds of thousands displaced during the June offensive. Host communities are being increasingly stretched, as the conflict in neighboring Syria has also led to a large influx of refugees, mostly into the Kurdistan region. </span></span>",

Following review of the cost extension concept note, ARC was asked by OFDA/USAID to submit a full proposal for a twelve-month, $300,000 USD cost extension modification request. The proposed cost extension will build on the success of the current OFDA-funded <i>Saving Lives in the Caribbean through Preparedness</i> (<i>Saving Lives</i>) project. Under this initiative, we will further strengthen the readiness capacity of Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent &amp; Grenadines, and Trinidad &amp; Tobago, all which confront significant disaster risks. The proposed project will include interventions simultaneously at the most local level, through community response trainings, Community Disaster Response Team-led simulations (integrated with community-wide events), and small- scale mitigation projects, and at the Red Cross national society level, building first aid training capacity to promote first aid business and enhancing outreach to deliver life saving information using previously developed apps. We will also focus on integrating branch capacity building through program activities, thus promoting their further integration and development.</span></span>",

While the activities have proven effective in some contexts, programming in this way neglects to consider articulated community desires and indigenous coping strategies as the basis for program design. It also limits the scope of disaster risk reduction interventions to a core set of CBDP interventions that may not be the most relevant or effective in all environments or that could be strengthened by integrating additional sectors. The proposed integrated, participatory assessment initiative will result in better understanding of the key needs, vulnerabilities, and hazards of diverse, disaster prone communities as well as existing resources that may be mobilized to make them safer and more able to cope with hazards.   </span></span><span style=\"font-family: lucida sans unicode,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Participatory assessments will take place in eleven countries in the region, including: El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama, Nicaragua, Colombia, Paraguay, Ecuador, Belize, The Bahamas, Saint Lucia and Guyana. A number of target communities have been pre-selected as a result of current programming.  The remaining communities will be selected based on criteria issued specifically for this initiative. Research around participatory learning demonstrates that people are motivated to solve problems when they themselves participate in a solution.  Therefore, it is assumed that community members who partake in the participatory integrated, assessments will be empowered and directly benefit from involvement in the process. Recruitment for participatory assessments will focus on gender balance and equal representation of all members in the community, regardless of age, gender or ethnicity. An estimated minimum of twenty people per community will be mobilized as assessment participants resulting in at least 2,240 direct beneficiaries. Additional direct beneficiaries will be reached through skills and knowledge building activities such as First Aid training and Community Disaster Response Team (CDRT) trainings. At least ten people per community will participate in each of these activities. Therefore, an approximate total of 5,000 direct beneficiaries will be reached.</span></span>",

    "Summary__c": "This project addresses the challenge of engaging smart phone app users to quickly and accurately crowd source information about hazard impacts in a reliable way. The data collected will inform disaster response planning and decision making.   This project builds additional enhancements to already existing Red Cross multi-hazard apps available in Indonesia, Myanmar and the Philippines that enable users to assess and prepare, mitigate risks and take action while communicating government alerts and key messages from the Red Cross that will better prepare the public for whatever the future may bring. <br> <br>Emergency resources are often insufficient to fully satisfy the demands for professional help and supplies after a public disaster. Urban populations continue to expand worldwide; natural disasters are precipitating increased challenges to public health, welfare, and safety. Simultaneously, another trend has arisen—the use of social networking and crowdsourcing for disaster management and improving public health. Earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, violent storms, and influenza epidemics have proven difficult to manage despite all of our technological advancements. When a disaster occurs, sometimes the best way to save numerous lives is to generate a timely reaction to its outcomes. That puts extra emphasis on the importance of high-quality information management for emergency communications.<br> <br>Crowdsourcing has proven to be an informal process for obtaining information about desired services, ideas, or content. The Global Disaster Preparedness Center (GDPC), a resource center of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies hosted by the American Red Cross, proposes adding an enhancement to its existing multi-hazard apps to capture public reporting of disaster impacts in a way that quickly validates the extent of the disaster impact by querying other nearby app users. This chained effect can quickly map pockets or widespread hazard impacts, damages or other inconveniences such as power outage or disruption in other services. For example, if someone reports their home is flooded, nearby app users will receive a notification asking whether they too have flooding. The users will have an opportunity to quickly respond. If anyone answers in the affirmative, the notifications will continue. This result is a spontaneous ability to rapidly map communities or neighborhoods.  This potentially powerful tool is designed to provide real-time data enabling quick responses during earthquakes, hurricanes, flooding, or other natural disasters.  It also allows the alerting of people in affected areas and notifies them with key messages about how to stay safe or ‘what to do’ now information.  In contrast with established emergency management methods, crowdsourcing can provide faster localized information for situational awareness and assistance in disaster situations. <br> <br>This project seeks to capture the good will and self-motivation of app users, who during a disaster, frequently look to their smart devices for information and guidance. By asking users to report their current status or observation, Red Cross and emergency managers could radically reduce the time, effort and cost of doing preliminary disaster assessments in the moments following a disaster impact. Making crowd sourced information reliable and trustworthy is challenging especially as it is self-reported.  The GDPC approach will hopefully validate the self-reported through methods of triangulation and expanded mapping of responses.  By utilizing the multi-hazard app as the crowdsourcing platform, the public will have the added benefit of rich risk reduction content and access to warning messages. ",

    "Summary__c": "Honduras is a country highly vulnerable to many natural hazards including tropical storms, hurricanes, landslides, droughts, and earthquakes. Since 2015, Honduras has also been hit hard by the effects of the El Niño phenomenon which has caused a severe and prolonged drought in the country. The current drought, the ongoing vulnerabilities to disasters and the lack of appropriate response mechanisms at the local levels have affected many Honduran communities. Building off the experience of the American Red Cross in the region and the work of the Honduran Red Cross at the community level, the project seeks to build capacity at individual, community and institutional level to promote resilience to disasters and climate related phenomena as well as raise awareness and train communities and local authorities on good practices related to water, hygiene and sanitation. The project will work in the area of risk management, including activities such as vulnerability and capacity assessments, creation and training of community committees, the development of emergency and contingency plans, as well as the area of water and sanitation with activities such as PHAST trainings, water management training and micro-projects. ",

The first prong involves local-capacity building and mobilization through working with local partners to disseminate preparedness messaging and actionable information via channels such as radio programming, community forums, and trainings.  The second prong leverages mobile applications for rapid information communication, through the First Aid App already developed by the Iraqi Red Crescent Society (IRCS) and through development of a Multi-Hazard app to contextually fit the region and specific hazards.  Through this dual outreach strategy of complementary traditional public education campaigns as well as use of new technologies, the proposed intervention will provide and amplify localized early warning alerts and preparedness information to hard-to-access governorates at risk of flash flooding. Enhancing communication networks through the proposed project will provide a significant opportunity for OFDA to support the linking of pre-disaster preparedness activities with the creation of post-disaster response capacity.<br><br>The Global Disaster Preparedness Center (GDPC), along with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the American Red Cross, is strongly positioned to lead this type of crisis communications intervention with the IRCS’s access, as well as the support and experience of the global RC/RC network.  The IRCS is an auxiliary to Government of Iraq disaster management plans, and an inherent part of the Government of Iraq contingency planning process.  With some 2,000 paid staff and 4,000 volunteers already working to reach vulnerable populations in Iraq, the IRCS will play an integral role in mobilizing communities exposed to the Mosul Dam hazard.  The IRCS is also already actively engaged in responding to the concurrent complex humanitarian emergency and associated displacement in Iraq, and as such has strong working relationships with other key humanitarian partners on the ground in Iraq, such as UNDP.  These preexisting relationships will facilitate coordination and cooperation between this project and other response activities being implemented.  The RC/RC network has solid experience utilizing PAPE messages in early warning campaigns and leveraging the First Aid and Multi-Hazard apps for early warning dissemination.  With the GDPC support and the RC/RC network’s knowledge and experience, the IRCS will enhance public access to preparedness information and guide individual and community decision-making to respond to this urgent threat.<br> ",

Prior to 2015, Zika outbreaks ocurred mostly in Africa,South East Asia and the Pacific Islands. In May 2015 the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an alert confirming the first Zika virus infections in Brazil. Currently outbreaks are ocurring in many countries in the region and in January 2016, the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) confirmed the presence of Zika in Haiti. As of March 18th, 2016 1,777 cases of Zika virus infection have been reported in Haiti.<br><br>The Haitian Red Cross proposes to address the risk of a Zika virus epedemic in Haiti through community mobilization and vector control. Two of the six strategic approaches set out by MSPP to fight the epedemic.<br><br>The project will target the areas of the West Department (Carrefour-Feuilles and Canaan), the North Department (Cap-Haitian, LaVictoire, Borgne, Ranquite, and Bahon), and the Northeast Department ( Ouanaminth, Haut Maribahoux and Bah Maribahoux).",

The project will also work to strategically link communication and education interventions for sexual prevention of HIV with other health related services and commodities, including targeted condom promotion and availability, as well as livelihoods initiatives for most-at-risk populations and those in settings characterized by high risk behaviors.

    "Summary__c": "This project aims to build the capacity of communities and schools to mitigate, prepare for and respond efficiently to disasters in the province of Los Santos, Panama. Los Santos is located south of the Azuero Peninsula and is made up the following districts: Los Santos, Guararé, Las Tablas, Macaracas, Pedasí, Pocrí and Tonosí. Currently, an extended period of drought has resulted in devastating social and economic consequences for the population of Los Santos, namely a significant water shortage for human consumption and agricultural use. As the communities of Los Santos do not have the capacity to prepare for or respond to such risks and disasters, the effects of this drought have only been compounded – demonstrating the necessity of new strategies and interventions to build the communities’ coping capacity. Considering its substantial history working in coordination with both governmental and nongovernmental institutions, the Panamanian Red Cross is uniquely well-positioned to implement community capacity building activities. Through the Panamanian Red Cross, the proposed intervention aims to work with communities, schools and Civil Protection organizations to strengthen capacity to be better prepared for and respond to future disasters at all levels by creating effective and sustainable practices for risk reduction, healthy hygiene habits, safe water management, and promoting behavioral and attitudinal change toward the care and maintenance of ecosystems. In order to achieve these goals, it is important to strengthen the level of social organization of these communities, providing knowledge, tools and opportunities for improvement to connect initiatives at the community with provincial and regional level actors.",

UNOPS  engaged  in  three  different  housing  solutions  in  order  to  address  the  issue  of  lack of  housing  in  informal  urban  settlements: Repair  and  reinforcements,  Single  core expandable  houses  and  collective  site.</span></div>\n\n<div> </div>\n\n<div><span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">The  main  objective  of  this  request  is  to  seek funding  for  the sanitation  component attached  to  the  housing  program.  In  light  of  the  request  of  the Direction  Nationale  de l&#39;Eau  Potable  et  de  l&#39;Assainissement (DINEPA),  the  National  Water  and  Sanitation Agency,  of  having  a  toilet  for  each  new  house  constructed,  the  project  is  in  need  of  350 sanitation  packages  that  include  the  septic  tank  and  related  plumbing  to  finish  the program.  This  would  cater  to  350  families  who  are  in  need  of  housing  in  the  neighborhoods  of  Pétionville  and  Turgeau. Since  this  falls  inside  of  the ongoing  16/6  project,  the  requested  funds  are  only  for  labor and  material,  as  all  UNOPS  personnel  are  covered.  </span></div>",

    "Summary__c": "In December 2013, El Salvador’s third highest volcano, Chaparrastique, erupted causing thousands to flee their homes. The Salvadoran Red Cross responded immediately providing assistance to the communities and coordinating with local authorities. Despite these efforts, this event demonstrated that communities were neither well prepared nor organized to respond to the event. With the volcano remaining active and the compounded threat of climate related event such as the current El Niño, advance preparation and mitigation is essential. This project build off the current and previous phases of the Building resilience in Chaparrastique Volcano Affect Communities project to ensure that a wider reach of communities and schools within the direct vicinity of the volcano are better prepared for and able to respond to future disasters. The project targets 7 communities and includes activities such as first aid training, creation of community disaster plans, installation of early warning systems, livelihoods training, land use and conservation training and simulation exercises which will increase community knowledge and preparedness to address future disaster hazards and risk. In order to increase knowledge and preparedness in the school systems, trainings in First Aid and evacuation and school protection plans developed, as well as workshops on climate change will also be implemented. Lastly, communities will also receive training in water and sanitation and receive water storage containers that will allow them to have access to safe water.",

While developing this expertise, J/P HRO has witnessed first-hand how rubble removal leads to the reinvigoration of local communities through improved safety and rebirth of businesses, schools, health centers and commerce. Furthermore, on-site construction training of local Haitians translates into future work in the construction trade, providing long-term employment in the communities, over the years of rebuilding to come.",

Widodo&#39;s administration has deployed thousands of military personnel to fight the fires, including in an attempt to get water into peatlands, which ignite extremely easily when dried out. During a recent discussion with  Pak Jusuf Kalla, and other Board Members of PMI,   there were a number of  significant gaps  mentioned that still require support,  most especially supporting PMI to more proactively assist the Ministry of Health (MOH) in providing safe air spaces to those most negatively impacted was high on this  priorities. The Indonesian military also has positioned ships off the coasts of hard-hit areas to facilitate evacuations of children and other vulnerable people should that become necessary.</span></span><br> <br><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">The Government of Indonesia’s (GOI) Ministry of Health will continue to focus its response on providing more public clean air spaces, particularly where vulnerable people are being evacuated. The government has identified local public buildings (health posts, community halls, PMI health centers and blood banks, etc.) in affected areas and provided required assistance to persons suffering from acute respiratory infections, with equipment, such as air purifiers, air conditioning, beds, oxygen, etc. The Ministry’s efforts also include providing in-patient and out-patient health care and treatment at health facilities. </span></span><br> <br><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Last week, USAID granted $150,000 to support <i>Palang Merah Indonesia</i> (PMI) through the American Red Cross as part of its response to haze-affected people in Riau, South Sumatra, and Central Kalimantan. This first phase intervention was initiated on Oct 29<sup>th</sup> by PMI Chairman and RI Vice President Jusuf Kalla and focuses on distributing masks (around 170,000 N95), health messaging, and supporting local health facilities and clean air buildings. With these activities beginning, PMI seeks to carry out a more effective intervention and more significantly support the GOI, which requires additional resources, particularly at the community level. Therefore, this proposal note requests consideration for awarding an additional $350,000 to intensify and broaden the level of support to smoke-haze affected  populations and enable PMI to more proactively support the GOI MOH response to this crisis.    </span></span><br> <br><b><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">2)</span></span></b> <b><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Needs summary and intervention measures </span></span></b><br> <br><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">PMI requires resource to support and augment </span></span><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">GOI operations, particularly </span></span><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">government health facilities (<i>Puskesmas</i>-Public Health Centers, Hospitals) and other </span></span><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">recognized </span></span><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">local </span></span><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">facilities. PMI also seeks resources to support interventions in in areas where it has existing health facilities, such as clinics/hospitals/mosques/blood banks, where safe clean air spaces can be made established and available or improving access to people requiring support and assistance with respiratory problems. </span></span><br> <br><span style=\"color: windowtext;\"><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">As most households do not have facilities that can ensure clean filtered air  and current MOH  facilities have been inadequate to meet  demand, especially from those who are most vulnerable, including  children, elderly and those with astmatic problems, this project  will  support existing public community facilities to augment exiting MOH facilities and provide  additional support to those most adversely  affected.  In some of places, “Clean air space/building” called “Rumah Singgah Asap” in Bahasa  Indonesia has proven to be an  effective temporary shelter to those most  affected by the smoke haze crisis, including those most vulnerable , such as children, </span></span></span><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">pregnant women, and elderly. Local government officials, along with PMI, have identified and set up such facilities  within    community health posts (Puskesmas) mosques (haj dormitory), community halls (Balai) local government buildings etc. (see phots below), as <i>Rumah singgah asap</i> by providing air purifiers and or air conditioner, masks, beds, oxygen, ambulance, health personnel (doctor and or nurse), public kitchen and event space for playing for children. The facilities and services provided are varied depending on the local capacity and provided free to all people in need. </span></span><br> <br><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">In these public clean air spaces, health personnel check on affected person’s health status, provide health promotion, and psychosocial support, especially for children. The  majority of those using these facilities are outpatients, while there are also some people, who require more intensive attention and spend  a few days at these facilities, in order to recover from the acute respiratory infection.  Ideally, there should be at least one <i>Rumah Singgah Asap </i>in each affected sub-district to ensure easy access and or sufficient coverage. These <i>Rumah Singgah Asap are being</i> promoted to communities, so they are aware of them and utilize these facilities when needed. PMI with its significant volunteers and staff (including doctors and nurses) can be fully mobilized to support this services. In addition, when needed, PMI with clinics and or blood transfusion units could use their building facilities to provide similar services. </span></span><br> <br><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">At the district level, PMI is a respected as disaster lead response organization, with its unique strength: its volunteers. PMI have been consistently participated in coordinating with local government and communities they come from for this haze response – assisting to distribute masks, health messages, etc., in close collaboration with Public Health centers and District health offices. Therefore PMI support will continue to add and increase its value to local government as well as to affected communities with the proposed response actions below.</span></span><br> <br><b><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">3) </span></span></b><b><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Proposed Response Action</span></span></b><br> <br><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">The following measures are proposed for this second phase of appeal: </span></span><br> \n<ol><li><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Supporting forty five (45) the “safe and clean air spaces and shelters.”   It is proposed to have 15 shelters per province targeting 3 to 4 of these for each of the worst affected districts.  Each of these facilities will, on average, be able to handle 9 in-patients and 20-30 out-patients per day. The support required for these shelters, will include procurement of small equipment for clean air provision (A/Cs and/or air purifiers), and other associated operational costs of these emergency respiratory health related activities. All these facilities will operate in close coordination with Ministry of Health (MOH)   standards and coordinate with them and in some cases be staffed by them. </span></span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Supporting the cost of local health personnel mobilization (such as per-diem and transportation), either from government or PMI volunteers (nurse, doctors) within two months. </span></span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Provision of oxygen and simple plastic tents to support the treatment of those with acute respiratory problems at the existing health facilities.

Hundreds of temporary shelters of earthquake survivors were blown away when a strong storm entered through the settlement. Based on the preliminary report received from Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) Rasuwa District Chapter more than 750 households were affected. Also it has seen wider physical damages in public buildings, security posts, schools buildings, health facilities and power lines across the district. The northern VDCs in the district were hit the most by the strong wind. </span><br><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">After coordination with local Nepal Government authorities, the NRCS Rasuwa decided to request Galvanized Iron Sheets (CGI) with NRCS Headquarters as an immediate relief to provide to the storm affected families. These wind storm affected families were affected by earthquake and living in temporary shelter.  </span><br><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">NRCS DC immediately alerted its Sub-chapter to collect the data of damages consulting with local security forces. As of 28 March, NRCS shared the assessment report which shows the numbers of affected household at VDC level as shown in table to right. Similarly, NRCS DC has been regularly coordinating with District Disaster Relief Committee (DDRC) to collect beneficiaries list  to be supported and initiating the required resource to respond storm affected population to NRCS Headquarters. The DDRC have identified CGI along with necessary fixings is a prime need at the field as tarpaulin roofs are unable to bear the pressure of strong winds in affected areas.</span><br><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Coordination and Response</span></b><br><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">The DDRC organized a meeting at district headquarters and decided to carry out rapid assessment mobilizing the network of security forces and Red Cross. Meeting also made decisions to request CGI sheet to National Earthquake Authority (NRA) and humanitarian agencies and all relief efforts will be handled through one door system getting the approval from DDRC.</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">NRCS DC participated in DDRC meeting held on 24 March and continuously sharing the information to NRCS HQs. At the same time, NRCS DC mobilized its volunteers to carry out rapid assessment in the affected areas. NRCS DC distributed 150 tarpaulins at Shyphru VDC so far. Following the decision of DDRC, NRCS Rasuwa requested to provide 700 bundles of CGI sheet to NRCS HQs.</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">NRCS DM Department already asked to District Chapter Rasuwa to share assessment report and deliver immediate relief in the affected VDCs. Based on the presence of Partner for earthquake recovery at field, NRCS have approached to American Red Cross for supporting emergency relief especially CGI to the storm affected families. After getting approval for assistance to respond from American Red Cross, NRCS HQs have proceeded the tendering process of 700 bundles of CGI sheet and fixings. </span><br><b><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Further Needs and plan</span></b><br><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Shelter NFIs such as tarpaulin, blankets, sleeping mat and CGI are reported as an urgent need in the affected areas. The roof of the most of houses are blown up by storm. As the affected areas are far from the district headquarters, </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">the assessment is still ongoing and detail needs will be identified within next few days. </span><br><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">The NRCS HQs has asked the beneficiaries list with Rasuwa DC. Similarly, a detailed plan of CGI distribution at the storm hit areas have been preparing from the district chapter. The NRCS have prepared a budget sheet of expected expenditures for storm response and submitted to American Red Cross for consent. The details timeline of purposed response activities are shown in table below. </span>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"

    "Summary__c": "<p class=\"p1\">\n\tThe 2010 earthquake devastated much of Haiti and damaged the Centre de Santé Communautaire (center) beyond repair. This event forced our staff to move into tents as the communities served by the center needed health services more than ever. Once the Spanish Red Cross discovered this situation, they committed funding to rebuild the center and will break ground in the next few weeks. However, due to budget constraints, the Spanish Red Cross is unable to fund medical equipment. This creates a gap in the St. Boniface Haiti Foundation’s ability to provide the best possible care. Prior to the earthquake, the center had a limited but sufficient supply of equipment. Much of this equipment had been donated by our main hospital or other organizations working Haiti. However, Haiti’s climate and the current working conditions have left much of the equipment inoperable. This proposal will fill the gap required to truly increase the health and well-being of Villa and its surrounding communities, with skilled attendants delivering babies and performing routine and case-specific testing for malaria, HIV and syphilis.  In immediate areas surrounding the center there are 15,000 residents who can directly benefit from its services. Based off previous years of data, the hospital averages 9,000 patient visits, 1,000 of which are patients under 14 years of age. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\tSBHF has seen three decades of working in Haiti. We have grown a one-room clinic into a 60- bed facility treating a variety of complex diseases.  SBHF has partnered with various INGOs such as CRS, CMMB and Food For The Poor in addition to multilateral and bilateral organizations such as UNICEF, CDC and USAID. Through these partnerships, SBHF has and is currently implementing large-scale initiatives in infant and maternal health, HIV treatment and prevention and spinal cord rehabilitation. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\tThe project will run for six months, starting August 1, 2013 and ending January 31, 2014. The target area for this project is Villa and its surrounding communities. Villa is located in the mountain of the Haiti’s southeast department. </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\tThe overall goal of the project is to improve the health and well-being of rural communities in and around the health center. This will be achieved by specific but interconnected objectives:</p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\"><li class=\"li1\">\n\t\tIncreased access to and usage of quality primary health care services</li><li class=\"li1\">\n\t\tImproved maternal and neonatal birth outcomes</li><li class=\"li1\">\n\t\tCurb the spread of infectious diseases. </li></ol>\n<p class=\"p1\">\n\tPrinciple activities revolve around the purchase, training and maintaining of medical equipment. The amount requested from the American Red Cross for this project is $100,000USD.</p>",

    "Summary__c": "Through the Universal App Program, the Global Disaster Preparedness Center (GDPC) and the Global First Aid Reference Center have created a platform to facilitate the adaption and localization of mobile applications (apps) with first aid and hazard information for use in countries across the globe, putting preparedness information directly into people’s hands. As part of the program, the GDPC closely works with Red Cross/Red Crescent (RC/RC) national societies to facilitate the adaptation and localization of app content. The First Aid app is live in 56 countries worldwide with over 40 national societies in the process of development in addition to the Hazard app being live in 15 countries. As of February 2015, the First Aid app has over one million downloads and counting.  The program is well on its way towards its target of releasing the First Aid app in 100 countries by 2016. <br> <br>The performance of all live apps and related user engagement is tracked using APIs from Google Analytics and App Figures. These sources provide national societies with the ability to monitor numerous data points including: number of downloads, number of new and/or active users, location of users, screen views, average session duration, and mobile device and operating system. To leverage the growing institutional experience and further support the implementation and roll out of First Aid apps there is need for an in-depth study on the success factors of the program.<br> <br>The diversity of countries participating in the program brings with it interest to gain a better understanding of how the apps are being used in the context of national society programming and for the benefit of the end users. In order to assess relative impacts of and experiences with the use of the First Aid app in different countries, it is first relevant to establish what constitutes ‘success’ in the context of the Universal App Program. With a growing number of countries involved in the Universal App program, a comprehensive comparative review of the program elements has to consider different regions, cultural, demographic or socioeconomic aspects as well as determinants of First Aid app use and knowledge transfer of the app content. This research will increase understanding of how apps can support national society service delivery for First Aid and enhance overall preparedness levels of the population. Research findings will contribute to future program developments and support potential app enhancements. <br> ",

The geographical spread of these communities is as follows; Bukombe District hosts two wards (Igulwa and Uyovu) with nine communities collectively while Mbogwe District hosts one ward (Lulembela) with six communities.  In the 15 communities, the project is expected to directly reach about 23,169 beneficiaries.<br><br>FY17 is the end year of this project phase and the project will continue to build communities skills, capacities and facilitate organization for enhanced disaster management, preparedness and response, as well as livelihoods activities addressing natural hazards that affect the Geita region, such as drought. Additional activities will address community-based health and first aid as well as promote proper health, hygiene and sanitation. Building on FY16 efforts, the community disaster contingency funds associations will be rolled out in additional villages. To ensure the sustainability the project work will continue to be delivered through the different existing community forums and structures in collaboration with the government and key influential traditional community leaders. Further, project efforts will also include building capacity of Tanzania Red Cross to deliver community resilience and disaster management programming. Other results expected as a result of FY17 activities include better organized communities with the capacity to act effectively to identify problems, resources, and integrate responses; and communities which are knowledgeable, healthy and have the ability to understand, assess, manage and monitor their resources, risks and behavior. In FY17, the project will conduct a comprehensive external evaluation exercise to evaluate effectiveness.<br> ",

The main groups of migrants are arriving via Greece&#39;s sea borders with Turkey, with six islands most seriously impacted by this increase - Chios, Crete, Kos, Lesbos, Rhodes, and Samos. Authorities have reported a three-fold increase of arrivals for the same period in 2014, and the numbers in the past weeks continue to increase dramatically. According to available data, more than 90% are coming from countries experiencing war and conflict, principally Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia. ",

In 2004/2005 children from 9 months to 15 years were given the measles vaccine through a campaign, Catch up program and in 2008 follow up campaign was conducted where children from 9 months to 5 years were provided with measles vaccine. Similarly, in 2012 a mix dose of measles and rubella was given to children from 9 months to 15 years through a Measles- Rubella Campaign. According to WHO, the number of measles and rubella cases decreased after these campaigns. Therefore, the Government of Nepal (GoN) plans for campaign every 3-4 years. As a result this National Measles- Rubella Campaign, 2015/2016 has been planned. The 1<sup>st</sup> phase of the campaign in 14 most earthquake affected districts has already been completed and the campaign activities for the remaining 61 districts has been planned.<br>Ministry of Health and their partners, including Nepal Red Cross Society, are working towards achievements of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) through improvements in maternal and child health. Nepal Red Cross Society, through participation in social mobilisation activities during mass vaccination campaigns, can assist their governments with achieving the MDG of reducing child mortality.<br> <br><b>Background</b><br>Measles is a highly infectious disease which can cause serious illness, lifelong complications and even death. But it can be easily prevented through vaccination. Clinically, almost similar to measles, rubella infection causes milder disease than measles. In pregnant women, the virus infects the placenta and developing fetus, rubella causes variety if physical defects, collectively known as Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS).<br>Coordinated efforts under National Health Policy contribute towards improving health status and achieving the MDGs. Increase in availability of health facilities and mobilization of health volunteers at grass root levels and promotion of public, private partnerships often contribute to addressing health issues at community level. Alongside this, humanitarian and development partners are also often pivotal in playing a key role in augmenting the Government of Nepal capacity to reduce the burden of measles and rubella.<br>Such efforts will be invaluable in contributing towards preventable diseases but also in working towards achievements of the millennium development goals (MDGs) through improvements in maternal and child health.<br> <br><b>Phases of the Measles Rubella Campaign </b><br>To ensure adequate supervision from regional and central staff and adequate logistical support for the measles rubella campaign, the campaign will be conducted in different phases\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tbody><tr style=\"height: 34px;\"><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width: 54px; height: 34px;\"><b>Phase</b></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width: 107px; height: 34px;\"><b>Phase</b></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width: 126px; height: 34px;\"><b>Planned Date for the Campaign</b></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width: 324px; height: 34px;\"><b>Districts</b></td></tr><tr style=\"height: 30px;\"><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width: 54px; height: 30px;\"><b>1<sup>st</sup> Phase </b></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width: 107px; height: 30px;\"><b>In 14 Districts</b><br>\t\t\t(Already completed)</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width: 126px; height: 30px;\">In Aug-Sep- 2015 (2072 Shrawan-Vadra)</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width: 324px; height: 30px;\"><b>Disaster Affected 14 districts: </b><br>\t\t\t<b>WDR</b>- Gorkha<br>\t\t\t<b>CDR</b>-Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, Dolakha, Sindhupalchowk, Kavre, Ramechhap, Sindhuli, Nuwakot, Rasuwa, Dhading, Makawanpur<br>\t\t\t<b>EDR- </b>Okhaldhunga</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width: 54px;\">2<sup>nd</sup> Phase</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width: 107px;\">  In 33 districts<br>\t\t\t </td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width: 126px;\">24 January 2016 (<b>2072 Magh 10</b> )</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width: 324px;\"><b>FWDR</b>-Darchula, Baitadi, Dadeldhura, Kanchanpur, kailali, Doti, Bajhang, Bajura and Achham<br>\t\t\t </td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width: 324px;\"><b>MWDR</b>- Kalikot, Dailekh, Surkhet, Bardiya, Banke, Salyan, Jajarkot, Rukum, Rolpa, Pyuthan and Dang (Supported by Danish Red Cross)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width: 324px;\"><b>WDR-</b> Gulmi, Arghakhanchi, Palpa, Kapilbastu, Rupandehi, Nawalparasi, Tanahu, Lamjung, Kaski, Syangja, Parbat, Baglung, Myagdi</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 54px;\">3<sup>rd</sup> Phase</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 107px;\">In 21 districts</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 126px;\">Feb 2016 (<b>2072 Magh</b>)</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width: 324px;\"><b>CDR-</b> Chitwan, Parsa, Bara, Rautahat, Sarlahi,Dhanusa and Mahottari</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width: 324px;\"><b>EDR- </b>Khotang, Udayapur, Siraha, Saptari, Sunsari, Dhankuta, Bhojpur,Sankhuwasava, Terhathum,Taplejung, Panchthar, Illam, Jhapa, Morang</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width: 54px;\">4<sup>th</sup> Phase</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width: 107px;\">In 7 Himali Districts</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width: 126px;\">March 2016 (2072 Chaitra 17 )</td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width: 324px;\"><b>MWDR-</b>Humla, Jumla, Mugu &amp; Dolpa (supported by Danish Red Cross)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width: 324px;\"><b>WDR-</b>Manang &amp; Mustang</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width: 324px;\"><b>EDR-</b>Solukhumbu</td></tr></tbody></table>\n <br> <br> <br><b>Proposed activities for NRCS Campaign Coverage</b><br><span style=\"font-family: times new roman,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">NRCS has been involved in previous immunization campaigns in three key areas, which have included firstly, NRCS local chapters mobilizing its volunteers at vaccination booths, secondly NRCS have carried out social mobilization activities in focused geographical areas and thirdly NRCS have integrated immunization dissemination and motivation messages for routine vaccination in relevant health projects.

To help reduce disaster risk and enhance community resilience in the region, the American Red Cross is working with Red Cross partners in the Bahamas, Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guyana, Nicaragua, Panama and Peru to address local hazards and vulnerabilities in over100 disaster-prone communities. This initiative began with a Red Cross-led mapping and assessment process where communities themselves identified the most significant risks they face and the actions they can take to mitigate them. Some examples of community interventions include strengthening water and sanitation systems, delivering key messages about health promotion and disease prevention, and training and equipping community members with first aid skills and supplies. In addition to addressing specific hazards, another key program component is working with communities so they are able to self-organize and self-manage advocacy or education efforts that will help them be better prepared for future disasters.  The American Red Cross is also helping strengthen the capacity of Red Cross partners in the region to deliver services to communities. This program is being implemented in Bahamas, Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guyana, Nicaragua, Panama and Peru, targeting more than 100 communities.",

    "Summary__c": "The present extensión of RITA Project for the fiscal year 2015 seeks to continue contributing to improve people’s life quality standards in five urban communities in Huaquillas Canton. Communities are located near the International Channel and at the south limits with the City Aguas Verdes in Peru. The communities to be attended are Choferes Sportman, 8 de Setiembre, Los Ceibos, Los Vergeles and Brisas del Sur.  <br>Families are prone to be affected during the Winter time by overflows of the International Channel. Furthermore, there are other type of risks associated with fuel handling and other risks to health, such as contagion of diseases caused by presence of stagnant water, garbage, poorly maintained water channels, limited sewage system and drinking water supply, and also health problems as consequence of the vulnerabilities mentioned before as Dengue, Malaria, Acute Diarrheal Diseases, which present more in children under 5 years old. To this situation is added delinquency problems, lack of security and community organization, and increase of the number of pregnancy in adolescents.     <br><br>It must be said that all communities in Huaquillas possess a governmental structure supported by the Autonomous Descentralized Government of Huaquillas Canton and a significant organization level capable to create high-impact changes. The Canton authorities have declared their intention to contribute to actions allowing for an improvement of the population health.  <br>For this reason, through the RITA Project, we want to contribute to creating resilience of communities by strengthening their organization, training, improvements in the physical environment and advocacy with the stakeholders of the Canton (local government and other instances are included). For the above mentioned reason, it has been deemed very important to consolidate the organization of communities through risk management teams and health committees, trained in risk prevention, preparation of community plans, healthy habits, basic first aid, drinking water management, environmental sanitation, sexual and reproductive rights, pacific coexistence. <br><div>\n\t<div id=\"ftn1\">\n\t\t<br>\t\t </div>\n</div>\n<br>",

    "Summary__c": "<span style=\"font-family: calibri,sans-serif;\">Every year, communities across southern Africa experience disasters intensified by climate change. The changing climate has resulted in unpredictable weather patterns, including increased intensity of rainstorms, prolonged dry spells and warmer temperatures. These changes increase the risk of flooding, crop failure, shelter damage, livestock death, soil erosion and increased prevalence of vector-borne disease. Combined with existing health, social and economic conditions, communities have a weakened capacity to respond to the shocks of climate change. </span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: calibri,sans-serif;\">With support from USAID/OFDA, the American Red Cross (ARC) has gained extensive experience in community based disaster risk reduction programming across the globe. That experience has helped inform our Building Resilient African Communities (BRACES) program, which since 2011 has used proven resilience programming techniques and lessons learned adapted to the southern African context. BRACES is a multi-year program designed to increase the resilience of communities in southern Africa. The approach integrates key interventions in other sectors – including shelter and water, sanitation and health – to provide a more holistic approach to disaster risk management that is more responsive to community-level risks. </span>",

Developed and tested a new membership system, the main feature of which is - transparency, feedback and larger coverage of attraction to potential members. The new membership system will also allow the Society to attract more funds into the organization&#39;s gross revenue from membership fees.</span><br> <br><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">The new website was developed, along with the development of KRC’s members, volunteers and partners accounting system. Functionality of the new site is also aimed at raising funds for the Society; the focus of it is to collect online donations and attract new members and volunteers. The team has started cooperation with the corporate sector, signed partnership agreements with several companies. Society has become a full member of the American Chamber of Commerce. A number of presentations for the corporate sector, the public sector and the general population were developed.

Research has showed that people are more willing to donate during emergencies, and are more willing to donate for the charity campaigns.  Therefore, it is essential that as many people as possible will learn about our new membership program and the opportunity to donate to the Red Crescent, both in time of peace, by supporting various charitable campaigns, and in the case of emergencies. Red Crescent plans to increase donations from the population by attracting new members to the society, as well as involving an increased number of people in charitable activities, creating different motivational tools and increasing their presence on the streets and in the online space.</span><br> <br><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">In addition, the Society needs the internal regulations’ analysis and bring them in line with new fundraising procedures and programs, in order to ensure that the resource mobilization activities comply with the laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan and provide financial transparency for donors and partners. This procedure by itself will require the assistance of professional lawyers. <br><br>The Director of the Resource Mobilization Department will coordinate all resource mobilization activities.</span></div>",

    "Summary__c": "The purpose of this grant is to support the Restoring Family Links (RFL) program in serving more clients through increasing awareness of Red Cross services to reconnect families separated internationally, especially in immigrant and refugee communities; enhancing client access to Restoring Family Links services, and improving service quality through training of caseworkers in the highest demand areas. In FY15-17, the Restoring Family Links program aims to serve more families that are separated from loved ones, provide quality casework services and eliminate barriers to accessing services.<br> In FY14, the Anne Ray Charitable Trust supported Restoring Family Links outreach and training efforts. The grant supported three staff positions, training of additional casework instructors and provision of outreach grants to local regions to raise community awareness. This support enhanced training capacity so that courses were regularly available in the top 20 American Red Cross regions and led to higher awareness and demand for services. <br> To ensure that high quality service is provided to families, instructor trainings will continue to ensure that guidance, tools and courses are available to caseworkers in the 20 regions with the highest Restoring Family Links case volume. Many refugee and immigrant families, as well as agencies and community groups that serve them, are unaware of Red Cross Restoring Family Links services. Direct outreach to communities, agencies, and organizations will focus on areas with large refugee and immigrant populations so that potential beneficiaries know about these services. Outreach mini-grants will be provided to regions to support local community engagement. In FY15, the Red Cross will also pilot a web form to make it easier for clients to learn about and utilize the program so that more families can be served.<br>The training and outreach initiatives for this three year proposal have low risk. The American Red Cross employs many training programs for its mainly volunteer workforce and the training modalities utilized by the RFL program are based on best practices from other Red Cross programs. The main challenges for training are maintaining and instructor pool in the top 20 highest demand regions which can change based on program demands as well as staff and volunteer turn-over. To address this challenge new instructor trainings and refresher trainings will be offered. For RFL caseworkers who do not have an instructor-led course readily available to them, on-demand online training modules are available and will be updated to meet caseworker needs.  For the outreach initiatives, the chapter grant program is now well-established, lessons learned have been collected and chapters are utilizing the grants in productive and creative ways. The pilot projects have inherent risk because they involve new activities. The structure and review of the pilot projects mitigates any high risk and the projects are flexible so that lessons can be applied quickly to adjust the programs to meet community needs. The pilot phone call projects are based on a similar program by the Mexican Red Cross where phone calls are offered to migrants at Red Cross health clinics. Employing best practices from the Mexican Red Cross program also helps to mitigate risk.  A new activity in this proposal is initiation of a web inquiry system so that potential RFL clients can have easier access to program information. It is designed as a pilot in the first year so that information on demand can be collected and case processes can be developed based on client needs. A moderate risk for the RFL program in general is the low capacity of the chapter network to provide RFL services and conduct outreach. This three-year grant proposal to ARCT requesting support for caseworker training and outreach initiatives directly addresses this ongoing challenge of the organization.",

Since mid-July, IFRC has been monitoring the situation and working closely with BDRCS in responding to the immediate needs of the affected communities. Cyclone Komen made landfall along the coast of south-eastern Bangladesh between the Hatiya and Sandwip islands on 30 July, weakening as it moved slightly towards the northeast. Cox’s Bazar, Chittagong, Bandarban, Noakhali, Feni and Bhola1 districts were significantly affected. At least 7 people (2 of them children) were reported dead, 38 missing, and a number injured due to the cyclone. Thousands of houses were flattened and trees uprooted. Many houses went under water, power supplies were disrupted, and communication systems ceased to operate in some places. Crops were damaged and shrimp projects flooded.",

    "Summary__c": "<span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">In 2015, Haiti continued to experience a huge increase of migrant arrivals in its territory on its border with Dominican Republic. Authorities are reporting at least 3,000 persons per week increase in arrivals in Haiti this month compared to the same period in 2014. </span><br> <br><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">The situation of irregular migration from Haiti is particularly problematic in the Caribbean region. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the three main Caribbean countries attracting the most Haitian migrants are Turkey and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic. The Turkish and Caicos Islands and the Bahamas represent both final destinations, as well as transit country for migrants seeking to enter the US territory. The main reason of destination to these countries is mainly due to the limited nature of border controls, the high demand for unskilled labour, particularly in the fields of construction and tourism, or access to medical care (Dominican law provides free health care).</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">The majority of these migratory movements are illegal, often through networks of traffickers, and migrants are particularly at risk when crossing borders through dealers or during travel by sea. According to the Coast Guard, 3,000 people were intercepted at sea and returned each month in Haiti. For example, April 9, 2015, in the town of Borgne northwestern department, boat heading towards the coast, resulting in the death of 17 people and the disappearance of 19, including 7 children, 12 people have been rescued.</span><br> <br><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">In 2013, the Constitutional Court of the Dominican Republic issued the Judgment &quot;TC 168/13&quot; resulting in withdrawal of nationality from a population estimated at 400,000 people, including 300,000 of Haitian origin. On 22 May 2014 the Dominican Congress passed legislation establishing a registration procedure and regularization of persons of foreign origin born in the Dominican Republic between 1929 and 2007 or &quot;Ley de Régimen Especial y Naturalización 169-14.&quot; This law established two distinct groups:</span><br> <br><b><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">- Group A</span></b><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">: consisting of 24,000 heads of families with members of their families (a total estimated 100,000 people) were born in the Dominican Republic and registered at the civil registry office;</span><br> <br><b><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">- Group B</span></b><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">: 55,000 heads of families with members of their families (200,000 people) were born in the Dominican Republic and have not been registered at the civil registry office.</span><br> <br><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">During his speech on the State of the Nation on 27 February, President Medina of the Dominican Republic said that the registration phase ended on 1 February 2015 and allowed the recording of 8755 persons belonging to Group B This includes 40% of the files that were deemed admissible for regularization and 60% rejected because of deficiencies in the submitted files (no information was provided about the Group A). </span><br> <br><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">The deadline for the regularization process was established at 17 June 2015 and that there would be no extension of the process and that all persons who have not been regularized to June 17 would be considered illegal migrants and exposed to deportation proceedings.</span><br> <br><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">In parallel with the above two groups, a third category is made up of an estimated population of more than 300,000 undocumented Haitian migrants, 250,000 of them would not have civil documentation.</span>",

    "Summary__c": "The American Red Cross and the Tanzania Red Cross launched the Tanzania Integrated HIV &amp; AIDS Project in May 2009. In FY17 project will target districts – Bukombe and Mbogwe – in Geita Region, Tanzania. It aims to reduce HIV associated morbidity and mortality, and improve the quality of life of the chronically ill, including people living with HIV and vulnerable children. The project addresses the effects of HIV in a comprehensive, holistic manner while working to strengthen the ability of the Tanzania Red Cross Society to implement and sustain HIV programming. The Tanzanian National AIDS Control Program recognizes Geita region as a priority site for HIV interventions. The project’s goal is achieved through the following objectives: to improve the quality of life of the chronically ill, including PLHIV, through provision of home-based care and support; to improve the quality of life of OVCs by increasing capacity of communities, families and OVCs; to promote HIV prevention by improving related knowledge, attitudes, skills and behaviors of youth in the community, and to strengthen capacity of TRCS, Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Seniors and Children and Tanzanian communities to implement HIV/AIDS programming.<br> ",

The market in the region, coupled with existing rich expertise and experience in the Movement as far as fundraising is concerned, have many ingredients for the RC/RC Societies to very quickly become market leaders in their countries if they are prepared to invest the time and resources in developing their fundraising outreach and get support and encouragement, along with exposure to skills and information, from their partners.</span></span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: arial,sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">To address this situation, the IFRC Europe Zone&#39;s Organisational Development unit has embarked on a Capacity Building in Resource Mobilisation project, which aims to contribute to the increased capacity of National Societies in the region to maximise domestic funding opportunities and growth. This will be achieved through provision of targeted, comprehensive and longer-term technical and financial support to five National Societies per annum that will express strong willingness and commitment to significantly grow their income.  It is expected that as a result of this support they will use evidence-based decision making in resource mobilization (RM), and will reach established RM performance targets. In addition to the targeted support, the project will ensure that all National Societies in the region receive and share resource mobilisation expertise, knowledge and innovations on a regular basis, including through the fundraisers’ networks that will be established in 2015. </span></span>\n<p style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 10.0pt;\">As an element of this project, with support from PNS including Swiss, British Red Cross, ICRC, and the American Red Cross, an initial meeting of National Society staff engaged in fundraising will be held in Budapest from 25 to 27 November 2014 at a total cost of CHF 40,000.  In alignment with current ARC plans to streamline engagement with National Societies in Eurasia subregion, ARC staff have determined that support for Resource Mobilization efforts and capacity building in this area will constitute a key element of the more limited future support that can be provided to operating National Societies in the region, while also capitalizing on successful efforts of the IFRC Europe Zone and working to build sustainability for the NS with which ARC has engaged over a number of years.  In particular for Kazakhstan Red Crescent and Kyrgyzstan Red Crescent, which have received project-based Organizational Development support from ARC, and Turkmenistan Red Crescent, which has also received ARC support for Disaster Preparedness and shorter-term OD initiatives, the successful organization and completion of the Fundraisers&#39; Meeting in Budapest, and follow-on activities, will be an important step in achieving lasting and sustainable improvements.</p>\n ",

    "Summary__c": "<span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The first fundraising meeting in Russian language was held in Budapest in November 2014 and was attended by 28 participants from 15 National Societies. </span><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The second fundraising meeting was held in Almaty, Kazakhstan, in June 2015 and saw participation of 42 people, including from 16 National Societies of Eastern and Southern Europe, Central Asia and South Caucasus</span><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">. </span><br><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The cross cutting theme of the second Fundraising Meeting focused on building longer-term and trusting relations with donors, in particular with individual donors. Sessions and discussions during all three days of the meeting were delving into the importance of developing and establishing a proper fundraising system that will aim to bring in regular un-earmarked income on a monthly basis, year on year.</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">One of the important highlights of both, the first and the second fundraising meetings, was participation of Senior Management of many National Societies. To ensure longer-term commitment of donors and their readiness to make larger contributions a few fundamentals need to be in place, and it is for the leaders of National Societies to prioritise and develop these:  </span>\n<ul><li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The first is a sound fundraising strategy for a few years ahead highlighting priority income streams, approaches, activities and resources needed to develop these income streams, how the income pattern will look like year on year from different income streams and how our costs will be covered. </span></li><li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The second, and often neglected area – is a need to have a dedicated, motivated and professional team. Fundraising will never become a system that brings good and regular income every month if no investments into having a strong fundraising team are made.</span></li><li style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The third is the need for infrastructure, for example a sound data base, a good web-site, varied payment mechanisms appropriate for different donors etc. </span></li></ul>\n<span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">All participants requested that such event becomes a regular occasion. </span><br><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The evaluation of the meeting showed a continued need to strengthen membership schemes and to upgrade members to donors, to harness the power of corporate sector for fundraising, for resources and expertise and for contacts and networks, and to strengthen relations with Grant Making organisations and foundations.</span><br>Practical information                                                       <br><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The third combined fundraising and communication meeting will take place from 22<sup>nd</sup> to 24<sup>th</sup> of June 2016 in Budapest. The participants will arrive one day before and will depart one day after the event.</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">All fifteen National Societies from former Soviet Union will be invited to attend the event. The available funding will cover two participants from each National Society: a fundraiser and a communications professional or people who are expected to do fundraising in their National Society.</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">The meeting will also bring external speakers and trainers both within and outside the Movement.</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Professional simultaneous translation will be ensured during the meeting.</span><br> ",

By introducing interactive hazard preparedness apps in the region, the GDPC and American Red Cross will help partners increase public access to preparedness information and improve decision-making towards safety and resilience. The GDPC will provide Red Cross partners access to a web-based platform where they can adapt and contextualize the American Red Cross hurricane/flood app for release in their own country. The GDPC will also offer technical guidance throughout the app development process, sharing resources for translation and marketing for the apps, among others. This 18-month project is funded by the United States Agency for International Development’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA).</span></span>",

    "Summary__c": "Following the January 2010 earthquake, Haiti has experienced tremendous challenges in its recovery, especially in hilly and densely populated urban neighborhoods. In order to allow those affected by the earthquake to return to more secure homes, it is necessary to address their diverse needs more effectively and efficiently, through an integrated approach that encompasses land and housing, water and sanitation, health, disaster risk reduction and livelihoods interventions. Phase I of LAMIKA has focused on conducting participatory assessment and design activities in the target area of Campeche, a neighborhood in Carrefour Feuilles, Port au Prince. Over the next three years, the American Red Cross will implement LAMIKA with the goal of enhancing community and household resiliency while providing safer, healthier and more secure living conditions.  LAMIKA will contribute to a more hazard resistant Port au Prince and a better future for Haiti. LAMIKA will conduct activities in social empowerment, economic strengthening and physical renewal to address needs across sectors.  Likewise, activities will be designed to respond to needs at various scales, from the individual household to the municipal and national level.  The overall implementation strategy will be driven by a community-based, participatory approach. This project expects to reach an estimated 45,000 people with a range of services. The American Red Cross is coordinating with a number of government and humanitarian partners to achieve and expand this vision. ",

    "Summary__c": "Throughout the Red Cross Red Crescent (RCRC) network and the wider humanitarian community there is an increasing recognition of the need and value of collecting and producing evidence to support and enhance humanitarian work across all sectors. Conducting research is an important part of building an evidence base and can make a number of valuable contributions to humanitarian work, including more reliable knowledge about what works and what doesn’t work and why. This can lead to more efficient aid, an increase in impact, heightened credibility of humanitarian work, more accountability and an understanding of future trends.<br><br>In 2012 the IFRC commissioned a study to compile and assess the existing experiences with research and the need to build capacities within the RCRC network. More recently, this has been complemented by an analysis of research needs and capacities in the IFRC and National Societies. These assessments highlight a great diversity of engagement in research activities across the IFRC and National Societies; however, there is a lack of collaboration and information exchange on research activities. Key findings of the assessments include the need to build a common vision for and understanding of research and evidence across the network and a demand for enhanced knowledge and information sharing to learn from otherwise dispersed research activities.<br><br>There are growing institutional experiences with research within the RCRC network but much remains to be done to build on collaboration and information exchange between different actors. As a resource to the RCRC network the Global Disaster Preparedness Center (GDPC) is supporting research activities and collaboration efforts to support RCRC’s work. Jointly with IFRC’s Learning and Research Department, and together with a diverse group of National Society, IFRC secretariat and Zone representatives, the Center seeks to initiate a workshop to focus and synthesize the discussion on research understanding and collaboration within the RCRC network. The RCRC workshop on research and evidence based work is planned to take place in Geneva, Switzerland, May 19 - 20, 2015. ",

If anyone has ever wondered about what kind of staffing structure to use on a new project, how to motivate their staff/teams, or how to navigate issues and mediate difficult situations, there has been no adequate interventions implemented focusing on Africa Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies to strengthen the leadership in respective countries. In light of this, there is a need to strengthen learning about leadership in a humanitarian context and create opportunities to discover what suits each national society on their style and their own organisations. It is therefore imperative to continually carry out organizational environment scanning to identify leadership practices, capacities that exist and crucial developmental needs. It is also envisaged that by developing a systematic evaluation framework of EHLP, this will provide an opportunity to gauge the significant impact both at individual and organizational levels. Gaps identified and recommendations made coupled by the findings of planned assessment will be useful to inform the future design, delivery and content of the training programme. </span></span><br><br> ",

    "Summary__c": "<span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">On April 25th, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck 48 miles northwest of Kathmandu, Nepal, affecting an estimated 8 million people across 41 districts in Nepal’s West and Central Regions.  Of these 41 districts, 14 have been identified as highly affected.  Preliminary assessments found the districts of Nuwakot and Rasuwa—in the Central Region—to be among the most severely impacted, with an estimated 80–90 percent of houses damaged or destroyed.  </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Many areas of Nuwakot and Rasuwa are only accessible on foot and have thus received limited assistance to date, compounding the urgency to respond</span><br> <br><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">After the earthquake struck, the Nepal Red Cross—which has branches in all 75 districts of Nepal—immediately deployed its national- and district-level disaster response teams to the most-affected districts, including Nuwakot and Rasuwa.  In addition, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and over 30 national Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies have mobilized for the response.  </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">Nepal Red Cross teams are conducting assessments in all affected areas, as well as conducting distributions to provide shelter, drinking water and food to earthquake-affected populations. Rapid assessments have found that shelter materials, particularly tarps and plastic sheeting, are priority needs.   There is a limited stock of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) kits and shelter materials in country; however it is insufficient to meet the needs of those displaced by the earthquake.  </span><br> <br><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">In response, the American Red Cross, in collaboration with its local partner the Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS), proposes to save lives and alleviate the suffering of earthquake-affected populations in 17 Village Development Committees (VDCs) of Rasuwa and Nuwakot districts by providing emergency shelter materials, safe drinking water and improved sanitation options.  The American Red Cross and the NRCS request $534,920 for emergency shelter, non-food items (NFI) and WASH activities for a three-month period, as well as plastic sheeting from USAID stocks for distribution in remote VDCs of Rasuwa and Nuwakot districts.  </span><br> ",

    "Summary__c": "<span style=\"font-family: calibri;\">Since the beginning of the devastating cholera outbreak in October 2010, American Red Cross (ARC) work in Haiti has included activities in emergency response, referral, prevention and treatment. Despite the support provided by the Red Cross movement including other humanitarian organizations in the aftermath of the 2010 cholera outbreak, the need to eliminate cholera in Haiti remains. Cholera prevention and response was identified as one of the key priority areas that require continuous attention by the Red Cross partners during the humanitarian needs analysis carried out after the 3<sup>rd</sup> anniversary of the 2010 earthquake by HRC and IFRC in consultation with Haitian Government Authorities.  Following that assessment, ARC initiated a high level consultation in August, 2013 with a number of key cholera partners to understand the needs at the local and departmental level and how the Red Cross partners could use their strategic advantage to address these needs. Following the consultations it became apparent to ARC that the priority geographic areas that required support from ARC are the North, Northeast, Artibornite and the West departments. It was also evident from the assessment that the continued persistence of cholera in these departments is primarily due to lack of funding to support prevention and response programs. </span><br> <br><span style=\"font-family: calibri;\">Due to the ongoing needs in cholera prevention and response to eliminate cholera in Haiti, an additional $2,8 million was allocated to five organizations in support of the UNICEF short-term objective to reduce the annual incidence rate of cholera from 3% to less than 0.5% during the period 2013-2015. By focusing on the UNICEF strategy, ARC’s cholera prevention and response is in line with the Government of Haiti’s plan for the elimination of cholera in Haiti. These five organizations are the HRC, Swiss RC, Norwegian RC, FRC and Oxfam.</span><br> ",

Although the assessment will examine all drought-affected (14) provinces to determine water service availability and to  confirm which are the worst affected districts, information from the Indonesian Meteorological, Climatology and Geophysics Department (BMKG) 14 drought-affected provinces that will require temporary water supply assistance have been tentatively identified as: East Nusa Tenggara, West Nusa Tenggara, East Java, Central Java, Jogjakarta, West Java, South Sulawesi, North Sulawesi, South Sumatra, Lampung, Banten, West Papua, Southeast Sulawesi, and Central Kalimantan. Based on BMKG’s current situation analysis and projections, WFP assessments, and ARC’s electronic survey related to drought conditions, the program will focus on the following 5 provinces: East Java, Central Java, West Java, East Nusa Tenggara, and West Nusa Tenggara. The exact number of beneficiaries will be determined through the base-line assessment and verification of the existing situation.  Strengthening PMI regional disaster management readiness and response capacity will ensure that it dovetails well with other disaster response efforts by the government and private sector. This project will improve emergency supply coordination by working first with other stakeholders to better understand and address the immediate drought-related water supply problem.  Subsequently the project will build institutional capacity through improved management and coordination of other stakeholders’ efforts with PMI’s regional warehouse infrastructure hubs. <br><br> ",

The Salvadoran Red Cross responded immediately providing assistance to the communities and coordinating with local authorities. Despite these efforts, this event demonstrated that communities were neither well prepared nor organized to respond to the event. With the volcano remaining active, with small explosions being reported as recently as January 2015, and subsequent eruption or other natural disasters inevitable, proper preparation and planning is critical. This project build off the current phase of t<i>he Building resilience in Chaparrastique Volcano Affect Communities project</i> to ensure that a wider reach of communities, schools and local agencies within the direct vicinity of the volcano are better prepared for and able to respond to future disasters. The project targets 11 communities which have been selected based on their vulnerability and exposure to the volcano, leaving them at greatest risk to subsequent volcanic eruptions and landslides. The project will include activities such as first aid training, creation and training of community committees, creation of community disaster plans, installation of early warning systems, and simulation exercises which will increase community knowledge and preparedness to address future disaster hazards and risk. In order to increase knowledge and preparedness in the school systems, trainings in First Aid and psychosocial support will be conducted, evacuation and school protection plans developed, and school simulations carried out. Lastly, training in Damage Assessments (EDAN) and Management of Emergency Operations Centers (MACOE), Shelter management and School Safety (SSC) will be provided to local authorities to strengthen their ability to carry out rapid damage and needs assessments and enhance their administrative capacity.</span></span>",
