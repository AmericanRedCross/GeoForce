To run the test script, you must first install NodeJS on your machine.
You can download and install NodeJS at:

http://nodejs.org/

Then, cd into the project directory. Type:

    npm install

This will install the dependencies for the test script. To run the test script, type:

    node test-queries.js


You should only have to edit one file, salesforce-queries.js

Please add all of the queries that we need and run the test to make sure that each works.


Thank you!
