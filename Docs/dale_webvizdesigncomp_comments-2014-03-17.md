Complied Comments on Comp Design

#Online version
============
- Really like layout. Don’t like the blue on the first page.
- What would analysis and data checkbox filters show
- Spelling of analysis
- The type categorization is a bit quizzical: Why Program map, Haiti and Analysis and Data as choices. This maybe my lack of experience in the filter choices so far
- How recent are recent stories
- What are you uploading ?
- What is the legend at the bottom with the wheel chair and phone like icon?
- How will the stories change by the filter chosen?
- On page 3, I’m just curious why the cursor is on the cluster of 12 projects, but there are only 11 projects listed in the sidebar.
- On the final page, do the yellow and blue lines represent storm tracks?
- Header Text - how about some catchy messaging that highlights action people can take WRI's Global Forest Watch uses "Spread the word, share Global Forest Watch."
- Risk - do you mean exposure/vulnerability?
- Resent Stories header - maybe a more jazzy title "stories to watch" etc or is stories the best descriptor if we are talking about maps?
- Geography Filter - are these acronyms explained anywhere?
- Not clear what is included in analysis and data..seem like seperate categories
- Analysis What analytic tools are available? (Implies more tools)
- Types - What about other thematic areas? We should really track environment and  urban as well
- include links to twitter, FB..a counter that shows how many times page has been teweeted, links to stories, blog posts
- Option for Comms to share/export
- Could include more space by only showing 6 stories
- FAQ - I imagine there is info here like how do we define a disaster?, etc
- Footer Text - Maybe change background color in this areas. light grey.  lots of white.
- Connect With Us - What is this?  Is this about joining a list serve, etc.  May want to make more explicit
- Handicap symbol - what is this? unclear
- Are the contents under “Type” on page one fixed? – analysis is spelled wrong. Also, what do you mean by “type” – especially regarding analysis and data? Perhaps you can include a type for M&E – such as major M&E events going on (i.e. surveys, evaluations,)
- Is there a way to present “recent” stories by different views, like with more details? Similar to how you view in a folder w/more details, icons, etc.. on page 1.
- Page 4 –  on the right side of the window “project health” – what data is this based on?
- Page 5- “view by” – can you view by more than one sector but not “choose all”?

*Dale Comments*
Landing page
- No blue ocean on landing page until user zooms in and then switch basemap to alternate style
- Click on recent story would create modal similar to current Mapfolio?
- searchable tags? similar to github filter for license when creating a repo
- only display top 10 in the selected extent?
App page
- *Love* the font for Mapfolio
- what does the button under the zoom buttons do? collapse?
- lets use the standard sandwich button of just 3 lines
- inset map shows circle or current map extent?
- What is in the Philippines tab? Recent stories about the Philippines?
- How is Map Layers going to be layed out? No design for this is shown.
- How is Project Filter going to be layed out? No design for this is shown.
- How is Legend going to be layed out? No design for this is shown.
- If bottom modals fill up the map area then there isn't a lot of screen real estate. I like the idea that Recent stories goes away after the landing page.
- lazy load for more stories?
- sector popup implies a picklist of 'view by' functions.
- confused by the view by inclusion of a legend
- smaller fonts in 'legend' so we can include more information
- Like the map it button but can we make it the fold out map icon (To be provided by Dale)
- maybe just the map it icon without the text, text only on hover or something
- Begin Date should be 'Start Date' - globally
- ISD # confused what this is?
- Attribute headings aren't consistently bolded
- Project Health should be displayed as a dot not shading a region.
- Project Health as one of the donut hover types would be awesome.
- Disaster Map - Love the fake GDACS
-




#Print version
===========
- Hate the yellow border (and this map resolution it looks clunky)
- Way too many colors.
- Where is disaster response?
- Don’t like the blue, too old school. The blue in the online version is better.
- User Program / Project wherever you have Project (very ECOS centric view, but not everything is a project. Haiti for e.g.)
- What does ISD by itself mean? It has a number below it
- Project health – will show a color or evaluation number? If so, need to explain it
- I might be naïve but the legend for watsan and relief are a bit obscure (but if they are universally known, then ok I guess)
- Do the colors outlining the circles correspond to the colors of the icons?  In other words, does the cluster of 12 projects include health, GDHP, livelihood, HIV/AIDS, and relief projects?
- If the answer is yes to the first question, does the length of each color correspond to the number of projects with that focus?  In other words, does the cluster of 12 projects include more HIV/AIDS projects than GDHP projects?
- I think there are better choices for some of the icons.  For measles, I would stick with the shot icon we have been using instead of the scary biohazard symbol.  For watsan, I would use the faucet we have been using.  I’m not sure a stethoscope is the best icon for livelihoods.
- In the legend, measles is spelled wrong.
- I would switch the position of the title and logo, title should be most prominent.  The first thing people look at is the left corner
- I've been told by Comms that we can't abbreviate ARC for any public materials
- GDHP not sure what this is?
- WatSan Icon needs better icon. faucet, etc.
- Map needs source information?
- DRR better icon..shovel, mobile phone, etc
- Relief better icon, shelter materials, etc
- Livelihoods better icon (non medical) e.g., wheat grass, etc
- Should detailed info country level? community level?
- Begin Date --> Start Date?
- what about including implementing partners? donor? goal?
- Space for notes?
- Measles is spelled wrong in the legend
- What is GDHP?
- Why livelihood symbol a stethoscope? This doesn’t make sense
- Watsan symbol – cant’ there be anything else that is more wat/san related? Like a water droplet or would that be complicated on a map?
- What do the circles mean – explain the different colors within each circle please. Do they correspond to the colors in the legend (not really clear)?
- The print design with blue background is easier to see and preferable to the one on page 2, although could be personal preference.
