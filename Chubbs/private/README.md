This directory should have your settings files as well as confidential credentials.

This directory's contents are .gitignored, so that it's contents (other than this README.md and
the example settings file) will not be committed.

That being said, things can always be explicitly committed. It is absolutely essential that you check
the contents you have staged for a commit and ensure that nothing in this directory is being committed.
