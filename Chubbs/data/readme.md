This data folder holds various file formats that can be read and served by SpatialServer.
The formats include:
* .PBF .mbtiles files (Mapnik Vector Tile)
* .PNG .mbtiles files (PNG caches exported from TileMill for example)
* .SHP files (ESRI Shapefile Format)
* In-Memory Shapefiles - ESRI Shapefiles that you want to be loaded into memory (as opposed to reading the shapefile on every tile request)
* Rasters - GeoTIFF files may be placed in the rasters folder in order to be served.
